Create a folder named your_case_name under the :code:`im_client/config/cases` directory for your cases. For example: :code:`im_client/config/cases/IOT`

Create a file named :code:`your_agent_name.yaml` to serve as the configuration file for the agent, depending on the number of agents required, create the corresponding number of YAML files. For example: :code:`im_client/config/cases/IOT/Caterer.yaml`

:code:`your_agent_name.yaml` is divided into four sections: **server** , **tool_agent**, **comm**, **llm**。
