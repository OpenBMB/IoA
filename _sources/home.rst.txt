🌎 What is Internet of Agents?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Imagine if AI agents could collaborate like humans do on the internet. That's the idea behind Internet of Agents (IoA)! It's an open-source framework that aims to create a platform where diverse AI agents can team up to tackle complex tasks. For example, agents like `AutoGPT`_ and `Open Interpreter`_ can come together, share their unique skills, and work on problems that might be too tricky for a single agent to solve.

🚀 Key Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- 🌐 **Internet-Inspired Architecture**: Just like how the internet connects people, IoA can connect different AI agents across different environments.
- 🤝 **Autonomous Nested Team Formation**: Agents can form teams and sub-teams on their own, adapting to complex tasks.
- 🧩 **Heterogeneous Agent Integration**: Brings together agents with different skills and backgrounds, kind of like assembling an all-star team.
- ⏳ **Asynchronous Task Execution**: Agents can multitask, making the whole system more efficient.
- 🗣️ **Adaptive Conversation Flow**: The conversation flow is autonomously managed to keep agent conversations structured but flexible.
- 🔄 **Scalable and Extensible**: Easy to add new types of agents or tackle different kinds of tasks.
